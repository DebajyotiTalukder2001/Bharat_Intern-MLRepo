# BrainTumorDetection_Using_CNN
<strong>Brain Tumor Detection System using CNN:<strong><br>

* Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the imaging technique used to diagnosing brain tumor disease. Early diagnosis of brain tumors is an essential task in medical work to find out whether the tumor can potentially become cancerous. This brain tumor detection system is a system that will predict whether the given image (MRI) of the brain has a tumor or not.

* Deep learning methods are now often applied for object identification, classification, and feature extraction. A
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of deep learning algorithm that is particularly well-suited for image recognition and
processing tasks. It is made up of multiple layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.

* Trained the tensorflow model in Google Colab on a virtual Tesla T4 GPU and average accuracy achieved by the system is up to 93%.

* Used streamlit and Google Colab localtunnel API to deploy the model. Now, using Streamlit, any machine learning or deep learning
model and any Python project can be deployed with ease without worrying about the frontend.


<h2>Dataset Used:</h2>
Source: Kaggle

The dataset is already divided into train, test, and prediction. The train folder contains the images which will be passed as a training dataset. The test folder contains the images which will be passed as a test dataset. Then we finally predict the result by passing an image from our prediction dataset.

<h2>Technologies:</h2>

*	Programming Language: Python (Version-3.11).

*	Platform: Google Colab, Visual Studio Code IDE.

*   Libraries: NumPy, Tensorflow, Keras, Matplotlib.

*   Framework Used: streamlit
